1.(a) No, because e -> g and g is in C but e is not in C.

1.(b) {a,b,h}

2. Yes, since reliable broadcast channel is used, all the nodes will know if faulty nodes misbehave. We can let all the nodes have two rounds of communication and let all the nodes  send what they receive in the second round. Then there are two cases. The first case is that the commander is non-faulty and then the two faulty nodes will send wrong information to the remaining non-faulty node in the second round. This behavior will be detected by the non-faulty nodes. The second case is that the commander is faulty. In this case the remaining faulty node will send wrong information in the second round and then the two non-faulty nodes will detect the faulty nodes.

3. Noï¼Œ because there is a possibility that two faulty nodes which are not adjacent crash after they send messages to the same one non faulty nodes which makes the two non-faulty nodes unable to communicate anymore. Therefore, the final set message of two non-faulty nodes can be different.
